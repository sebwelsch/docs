Most eIDs distinguish between real users and test users.

**Real users** represent actual individuals who authenticate on your website, providing real personal information such as their name and typically a Social Security Number (SSN).

**Test users** are fictitious identities used for development and testing. Depending on the eID, you can either create your own test users or use pre-existing ones provided by Criipto.

For instructions on creating test users for each eID, please refer to [Test user guides](/verify/guides/test-users/).
