The goal of Criipto Signatures is to be fully customizable to fit exactly into your workflow.
In the short term, you can set a logo and theme the UI via CSS variables.

All UI settings are signature-order-specific, which makes it easy for you to customize based on the context. Plus, you can easily test new UI settings without affecting any new signature orders.

When creating a signature order via `createSignatureOrder`, you can customize the UI by defining the subproperties of the `ui` input variable.

[Full UI settings GraphQL Example](/signatures/graphql/examples/#signature-order-ui-settings)

## Logo

A logo can be added to the top of the signatory screen.

Set `ui.logo.src` to an absolute HTTPs image url, and we will add the image to the top of the signatory frontend.

You can also define `ui.logo.href` which turns the logo into a link.

```text
{
  "input": {
    "ui": {
      "logo": {
        "src": "https://www.criipto.com/hubfs/logo.svg", // required
        "href": "https://www.criipto.com" // can be left null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Stylesheet

A custom stylesheet can be added to the frontend to provide unique theming and styling options.

Set `ui.stylesheet` to an absolute HTTPs css url, and it will be loaded when the signatory opens their link.

```text
{
  "input": {
    "ui": {
      "stylesheet": "https://signatures-storybook.criipto.com/custom.css"
    }
  }
}
```

The fastest way to theme the UI would be to override our CSS variables to show your primary colors.

```text
.criipto-signatures {
  --primary-rgb: 128, 0, 128; // Change the primary color of the UI to purple.
}
```

### Storybook

You can test your stylesheet without creating a signature order by using our Storybook (BETA), which is a static rendering of our UI with dummy data.

[Open the Signatures Storybook](https://signatures-storybook.criipto.com) and paste a stylesheet URL into the "Stylesheet URL" input field. You can use `https://signatures-storybook.criipto.com/custom.css` to test.

### CSS Variables

Below you will find a list of all CSS variables that can currently be overridden.

```text
.criipto-signatures {
  --primary-rgb: 32, 76, 130;
  --danger-rgb: 206, 112, 101;
  --success-rgb: 128, 231, 144;

  --font-family: Raleway;

  --button-primary-background-rgb: var(--primary-rgb);
  --button-primary-color-rgb: 255, 255, 255;

  --button-default-background-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
  --button-default-color-rgb: var(--primary-rgb);

  --button-danger-background-rgb: var(--danger-rgb);
  --button-danger-color-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
}
```
