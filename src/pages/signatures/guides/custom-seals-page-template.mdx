title: Custom Seals Page Template
---

The [custom seals page template](/signatures/graphql/examples/#custom-seals-page-template) feature allows you to control the look of the signature seals page appended to your signed document.
Instead of the default blank page, you can add your own branded PDF as the background.

Follow the interactive tour below to see how this works.
