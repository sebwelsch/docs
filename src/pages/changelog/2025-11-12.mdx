title: Viewer role added for signing
---

## Viewer role

You can now specify a `signatoryRole` when adding signatories.

In addition to the default `SIGNER` role, a new `VIEWER` role lets you add participants who can view the documents without signing. Viewers do not block signing in parallel flows and can download the signed document once the signature order has been closed.
