title: Sequential signing is now possible

## Signing sequence

You can now control signing order in your signature workflows by setting a `signingSequence` on signatories.
Signatories with lower numbers sign first, while those with the same number can sign in parallel.

An example can be found in the [Signatures documentation](/signatures/graphql/examples/#signing-sequence).
