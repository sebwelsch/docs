title: Stronger accessibility requirements for Swedish BankID
---

From July 2025, stronger requirements regarding accessibility must be fulfilled to meet legal demands.
Amongst other things, these will affect the two-device flow for BankID where the animated QR code is used.

[Learn more about the new requirements](https://developers.bankid.com/getting-started/qr-code#accessibility)

In order to comply with the new QR code UI requirements Criipto must make adjustments to our UI (HTML & CSS),
so that users may click the QR code to view it in fullscreen.

This can cause breaking changes to customers who have custom CSS, so customers must explicitly enable the UI update. To comply with the new requirements, you must enable the UI update before July 2025.

You can opt-in to the UI update for the test environment, and even per application, before doing so in production.

To opt-in at a tenant environment level:
1. [Open dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com)
2. [Navigate to Styling screen](https://dashboard.criipto.com/styling)
3. Select 2025-04-01 in the "View version" dropdown
4. Click save

To opt-in at an application level:
1. [Open dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com)
2. [Navigate to Applications screen](https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications)
3. Select the application you wish to upgrade
4. Click the "UI" tab
5. Disable "Use default" for the "View version" option
6. Select "2025-01-04" in the "View version" dropdown
7. Click save
