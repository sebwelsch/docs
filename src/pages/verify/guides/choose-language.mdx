---

By default, Criipto Verify uses the _Accept-Language_ HTTP request header to figure out which language the user prefers.

You can override this per authentication request by specifying a `ui_locales` query parameter. This works for both OpenID Connect and WS-Federation, even if WS-Federation does not have protocol support for per-request language selection.

The actual support for controlling the language varies by eID method

1. Danish MitID: `da` and `en` supported.
2. Norwegian BankID: `nb` and `en` supported.
3. Norwegian Vipps Login: Language is controlled by user in the app.
4. Swedish BankID: `sv` and `en` supported.
5. Finnish BankID: `fi`, `se` and `en` supported.
6. Dutch iDIN: `nl` and `en` supported.
7. German Personalausweis: `de` and `en` supported.
8. Swedish FrejaID: `sv` and `en` supported.

Additionally, the following syntax is supported: `da-DK`|`sv-SE`|`nb-NO`|`en-US`|`de-DE`.
