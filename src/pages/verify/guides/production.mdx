Once you have developed and tested your application to work with test user accounts, you are ready to move ahead and work with real user eID accounts.

_Please note_ that for production usage, you need a paid subscription.

Follow these steps to get ready for production:

1. If you haven't done so already, go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com/billing), select the **Billing** tab, and choose a plan that suits your expected usage.
2. Next, you must acquire a production certificate for the eID provider(s) you plan to use in production.

**Ordering eIDs for production**

Each eID provider has specific requirements. Use the links below to review the necessary steps for each provider.

3. Change the environment from **Test** to **Production** on the top left corner of the Dashboard.
4. Go to the **Domains** tab and set up a production domain.
   - Note that if you choose a domain that ends with something other than `idura.broker`, we recommend going with the Idura-managed option ("Managed SSL certificate") for SSL certificate.
5. Go to the **Applications** tab and register your production application:
   - The **Client ID** must be unique; it cannot be the same as any of your other applications
6. Configure your website or application with the new domain, Client ID, and Client secret.

Once you have been through these steps, you are ready to start using real Swedish BankID, Danish MitID, and others in your production application.
