We are working on a Swift SDK, but until then, we offer an [example
project](https://github.com/criipto/criipto-verify-ios-example), which shows how to integrate
Idura Verify using the [AppAuth library](https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-ios/).

In addition to Verify logins, the example project also shows how to do app switching for MitID.

If you have any questions related to the example projects, feel free to open a GitHub issue, or
[reach out on Slack](https://dashboard.criipto.com/support).
