This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Idura Verify with OneLogin. The following steps are required to complete your first login:

1. [Register your OneLogin tenant in Idura Verify](#register-your-onelogin-tenant-in-idura-verify)
2. [Configure the OAuth2 flow](#configure-the-oauth2-flow)
3. [Create a OneLogin Trusted IDP for Idura Verify](#create-a-onelogin-trusted-idp-for-idura-verify)

## Register your OneLogin tenant in Idura Verify

First, you must create a new [application](/verify/getting-started/basics/#applications) for your OneLogin tenant in Idura Verify. This is done via the [Idura Dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications/add?tags=authentications).

![Create Application](./images/onelogin-create-application.png)

Once the application is created, you'll need some of its details for configuring OneLogin to communicate with Idura Verify. Gather the following information from the application settings:

- **Client ID** to identify your OneLogin tenant to Idura Verify. We chose `urn:idura:samples:onelogin` for this example.
- **Client secret** is needed if you choose the [back-channel](/verify/getting-started/oidc-intro/#authenticate-with-back-channel-authorization-code-flow) approach. The secret is generated when you [configure OAuth2 Code Flow](/verify/integrations/onelogin/#configure-oauth2-code-flow) for your application.
- **Domain** on which you will be communicating with Idura Verify. If your company name is Acme Corp, it could be, for example, `acme-corp.idura.broker`.

## Configure OAuth2 Code Flow

## Create a OneLogin Trusted IDP for Idura Verify

1. Authenticate to the OneLogin admin console with an appropriate administrative account.
2. Navigate to Authentication -> Trusted IDPs
   ![OAuth2 config](./images/onelogin-trusted-idps.jpeg)
   Please note: For additional information on OneLogin Trusted IDP please refer to the [Trusted IDP knowledge base article](https://onelogin.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0010318)
3. Select `New Trust` from the top right
4. Provide an appropriate name.
   Please Note: For each legal/bank identity that needs to be integrated with OneLogin, a separate Trusted IDP needs to be configured. For the purposes of this documentation NO Bank ID, will be used as the example.
5. In the Login Options section, if you wish to represent this Trusted IdP as an authentication option on the tenant’s login page via an icon, then check Show in Login panel and provide a url to a suitable icon. (Note: websites typically host a “favicon.ico” file that could be used e.g. https://www.onelogin.com/favicon.ico)
   In the example of NO BankID, [https://www.bankid.com/en/\_themes/bankid-www/img/logo1-default.svg](https://www.bankid.com/en/_themes/bankid-www/img/logo1-default.svg) can be used

6. In the Configurations section, enter the Issuer URL. This will be the domain chosen during the Idura Verify signup process.

- To review your domain in Idura Verify, navigate to Domains from the admin console and be sure to prefix `https://`

7. (OPTIONAL) The Email Domains field is used to automatically invoke this Trusted IdP when a user enters their email address at login time - if the email address is unrecognized, but belongs to one of the domains listed, then this TIdP will be invoked via an authentication request. This setting can be left blank if invoking this Trusted IDP from the OneLogin login panel is the preferred method.
8. Check `Sign Users into OneLogin` and deselect `Sign Users into additional applications`.
9. Scroll down to the protocol section select `OIDC` from the dropdown
10. Add `{tidp.email}` in the User Attribute Value in the User Attribute section or whatever is applicable to your use case. This is the attribute used for User attribute matching.
    ![User attribute](./images/onelogin-user-attribute.jpeg)
11. Select Email for User Attribute Mapping or the value applicable to your use case.
12. (OPTIONAL) Allowed Email Domains is a whitelist. This allows the administrator to restrict the acceptable email domains for inbound identities. If empty, there is no restriction.
13. The authentication endpoint syntax is as follows

- `https://<Idura Verify Domain Name>/<base64 encoded acr value for legal/bank id being configured>/oauth2/authorize`
- To identify what the base64 encoded acr value for legal/bank id being configured, please use [Supported login methods table](#loginmethods)
- Therefore, in this example of Norwegian BankID the following issuer will be used: `https://onelogintest-test.criipto.id/dXJuOmdybjphdXRobjpubzpiYW5raWQ=/oauth2/authorize`

14. Select BASIC as the Token Endpoint Auth. Method.
15. Add the relevant token endpoint. The Token Endpoint syntax would be: `https://<Idura Verify Domain Name>/oauth2/token`
16. Add the user information endpoint in the User Information Endpoint section. The user information endpoint syntax would be: `https://<Idura Verify Domain Name>/oauth2/userinfo`
17. Add the relevant scopes in the scopes section. At a minimum `openid` must be used.
18. Add the client ID specified in step 4 of the [Registration of the OneLogin tenant in Idura Verify](#register) to the Client Id section.
19. Add the Client Secret in the Client Secret section as noted in step in step 6 of [Configure the OAuth2 flow](#enable).
20. Lastly In the Trusted IdP Settings tab, head to the top of the page and check `Enable Trusted IDP` in the Enable/Disable field.
