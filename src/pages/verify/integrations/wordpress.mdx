## Write your own integration

Idura Verify is an OpenID Provider so if you wish to write your own wordpress integration with PHP
we can recommend the [jumbojett OpenID library for PHP](https://github.com/jumbojett/OpenID-Connect-PHP).

The library takes care of the major OIDC details.

## Wordpress plugin

Idura does not offer any Wordpress plugin directly but miniOrange offers a [WordPress OpenID Connect Client](https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-login-with-eve-online-google-facebook/)
for Wordpress and has also written a [tutorial specifically for Idura Verify](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-oauth-openid-connect-single-sign-on-sso-using-criipto).
