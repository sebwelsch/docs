## Testing

FrejaID is available to anyone, but some features are only available for Swedish citizens and EEA citizens with a coordination number (samordningsnummer) issued by the Swedish Tax Authority.
For testing, you can easily generate a test user with your chosen level of access (which FrejaID calls the "registration level").
You can use the [Authorize URL builder](/verify/guides/authorize-url-builder) to generate URLs for testing.

### Installing the Freja app

You can use the regular Freja app for testing.
Simply download the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freja/id1256552092) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verisec.mobile.frejaeid).

#### Configuring the app for testing

To use the Freja app for testing, you must activate test mode.
Note that the app will stay in test mode until you delete it from your device, so you should not use your normal Freja app for testing.

To activate test mode in the Freja app:

1. Open the Freja app
2. Press "New User"
3. Press "Get Started"
4. Toggle the "General Terms & Conditions" button six times
5. You should now see a screen saying "Welcome to Test Mode"
6. Press "Start Test Mode"
7. Press "OK" in the pop-up warning
8. The Freja app will now close

To create a Basic test user for the Freja app in test mode:

1. Open the Freja app
2. Press "New User"
3. Press "Get Started"
4. Accept the "General Terms & Conditions", the "Privacy Policy" and the disclaimer about falsifying identities
5. Press "Continue"
6. Press "Continue"
7. Press "Set Notifications" if you want to test push Notifications
8. Press "Allow" in the notification popup from your device
9. Enter your email address (it must be a real email address where you can receive emails)
10. Confirm your email address by pressing "Send"
11. Open your email account and press the "Confirm" link in the email from "Freja - TEST MODE"
12. Open the Freja app
13. Choose a PIN code and enter it in both fields
14. Press "Confirm"
15. Your device may ask you whether you also want to register biometrics such as FaceID or fingerprint for Freja - select "Allow" if you want to use it
16. Press "OK"
17. Press "Later" when asked if you want to upgrade your account

You now have a Basic Freja test user.

#### Upgrading to Freja Extended

To upgrade your Basic test user to Freja Extended in test mode:

1. Open a browser and go to the [Freja Test Vetting Portal](https://vettingportal.test.frejaeid.com/)
2. Enter the email you used to register the test user
3. Press "Upgrade"
4. Choose "Sweden" if you want access to test all features of Freja (and if you want to upgrade to Freja+ later)
5. Press "Next"
6. Select in a first name and a last name as well as a birth date and gender for the test user
7. Press "Generate" to obtain a personal identity number (social security number) for the test user
8. Write down the generated personal identity number - you will not be able to see it later
9. Press "Upgrade"

Your test user will now be registered as Extended, which gives you access to testing with more scopes.

#### Upgrading to Freja+

To upgrade your Extended test user to Freja+ in test mode:

1. Open a browser and go to the [Freja Test Vetting Portal](https://vettingportal.test.frejaeid.com/)
2. Enter the email you used to register the test user
3. Press "Upgrade"

Your test user will now be registered as Freja+, which gives you access to testing with even more scopes.

#### Adding a phone number

To add a phone number to your test user (for testing user binding via phone number):

1. Open the Freja app
2. Press "Settings" in the bottom right
3. Press "My Pages"
4. Press "Log In"
5. Press "Approve" in the popup
6. Confirm with PIN or biometrics
7. Press the "hamburger" menu in the top left
8. Press "User Details"
9. Scroll down to "Phone number" and press the green "+" next to the header
10. Select your country code and enter your phone number (it must be a real phone number which can receive SMS)
11. Press "Add"
12. Press "Yes"
13. Press "Approve" in the popup
14. Wait to receive an SMS from Freja with an activation code
15. Enter the activation code from the SMS in the box labeled "Enter activation code"
16. Press "Add"
17. Close the website popup

You can now use the phone number to bind requests to your test user.

## Integrating with FrejaID

### Registration levels

FrejaID users can be registered at three different levels.
The registration level of the user determines the scopes that will be available for that user.

Anyone can register for FrejaID with just their email, and will then get registration level Basic.
Users from most countries can register with their ID (e.g. their passport) and a photo, and will then get registration level Extended.
Users who have a Swedish identity number ("personnummer") or coordination number ("samordningsnummer") will instead get registration level Plus when they register with their ID.

### Scopes for FrejaID

You must use scopes on each authentication to select what information about the user you require.
All scopes mentioned below must be prefixed with `frejaid:`.
You will always receive a `sub` value uniquely identifying the user for your service, even if you request no scopes.

#### Common scopes

The following scopes are available for all FrejaID users:

- `email_address`: the primary email address of the user
- `all_email_addresses`: all email addresses registered for the user
- `all_phone_numbers`: all phone numbers registered for the user (may be an empty list)
- `registration_level`: the actual registration level of the user

#### Scopes that require registration level Extended or Plus

The following scopes are only available for FrejaID users with registration level Extended or Plus:

- `basic_user_info`: the first and last name of the user
- `date_of_birth`: the user's date of birth
- `age`: the user's age
- `ssn`: the user's social security number (based on the registration document)
- `addresses`: the addresses registered for the user (may be an empty list)
- `document`: information from the registration document, such as the type and expiry date of the document
- `photo`: a photo of the user
- `document_photo`: a photo of the user's registration document

To request these scopes, you must also set the minimum registration level to at least Extended (see below).

Note that the `photo` and `document_photo` scopes produce very large JWTs containing images.
These JWTs are not suitable as access tokens because they are too large for most browsers to store as cookies.
For this reason, single-sign on functionality is automatically disabled for authentications started with these scopes.
Additionally, JWTs containing photos are too large to return via an URL.
For this reason, you cannot request the `photo` or `document_photo` scopes in combination with a `response_type` and `response_mode` that would return the token in an URL.
For example, a request with `response_type=id_token` and `response_mode=fragment` will be rejected if it includes the `photo` scope.

#### Special scopes

The following scopes are only available by special arrangement.
Contact support if you would like to use them:

- `unique_personal_identifier`: a unique personal identifier which can be used to link FrejaID users across services
- `loa_level`: the eIDAS Level of Assurance of the user
- `custom_identifier`: a custom identifier registered by your organization in FrejaID's systems
- `document_photo`: a photo of the user's registration document

### Setting a minimum registration level

Some scopes are only available for certain registration levels.
You can select a minimum registration level with one of the following `login_hints`:

- Basic: `minregistrationlevel:basic`
- Extended: `minregistrationlevel:extended`
- Plus: `minregistrationlevel:plus`

Note that you will get an error if you select a minimum registration level that does not include the scopes you request.

### Prefilling user information

In some special cases, you may already know who you expect the user to be before they authenticate.
In these cases, you can restrict the authentication to the specific user by supplying one of the following pieces of information:

- The email address of the user
- The phone number of the user
- The country and social security number (SSN) of the user

To supply an email address, use the `login_hint`: `sub:email:<email>`. Replace `<email>` with the email of the user.
To supply a phone number, use the `login_hint`: `sub:phone:<phone number>`. Replace `<phone number>` with the phone number of the user (including a `+` and a country code).

Supplying a country and an identity number is only supported for citizens of Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway.
To supply the country of the user, use the `login_hint`: `sub:ssncountry:<country>`. Replace `<country>` with one of `SE`, `DK`, `NO`, or `FI`.
To supply the SSN of the user, use the `login_hint`: `sub:ssn:<ssn>`. Replace `<ssn>` with the SSN of the user.
For Swedish, Norwegian and Danish users, the SSN must be supplied without spaces or hyphens.
For Finnish users, the SSN must be supplied with a hyphen or the letter `A` before the last four characters of the SSN.

### Verifying user identity with photo

For users registered with a photo (i.e. users who are on registration level Extended or Plus), FrejaID supports additional verification of the user's identity on each transaction.
Enabling photo verification will force the user to take a photo of themselves when authenticating, then compare it with the registered photo for that user.
If the photos do not match, the user will be unable to approve the transaction.
You can enable photo verification with the `login_hint`: `userconfirmationmethod:defaultandface`.

## Signing text and data with FrejaID

FrejaID supports signing text and binary data as part of a regular authentication flow.
There are three types of signatures: Simple, Extended and Advanced.
All of the signature types allow you to present text to the user in the Freja app.

### Simple signatures

Simple signatures can be used to sign plain text.
The Simple signature flow is activated by adding `action:sign` in the `login_hint`.
The text must be provided in the `login_hint` using the `message` hint.
The text must be base64 encoded and no longer than 4096 characters (prior to base64 encoding).
The text will be shown to the user in the Freja app while authenticating.

[Try out an example Simple signature in our Authorize URL builder.](/verify/guides/authorize-url-builder/?acr_values=urn:grn:authn:se:frejaid&frejaAction=sign&message=Test%20simple%20signature%20flow&title=Simple%20signature)

### Extended signatures

Extended signatures can be used to sign plain text and some additional binary data.
The Extended signature flow is activated by adding `action:sign_extended` in the `login_hint`.
The text must be provided in the `login_hint` using the `message` hint, while the binary data must be provided using the `nonVisibleData` hint.
Both the text and the binary data must be base64 encoded.
The text must be no longer than 4096 characters and the binary data no larger than 5 MB (both prior to base64 encoding).
The text will be shown to the user in the Freja app while authenticating, but the binary data will not be shown to the user.

[Try out an example Extended signature in our Authorize URL builder.](/verify/guides/authorize-url-builder/?acr_values=urn:grn:authn:se:frejaid&frejaAction=sign_extended&message=Test%20extended%20signature%20flow&nonVisibleData=TEST_BINARY_DATA&title=Extended%20signature)

### Advanced signatures

Advanced signatures can be used to sign plain text and receive a response that is compatible with the "Mina meddelanden" digital communication platform in Sweden.
The Advanced signature response is tied to the user's personal data and can be independently validated.
The Advanced signature flow is activated by adding `action:sign_advanced` in the `login_hint`.
The text must be provided in the `login_hint` using the `message` hint.
The text must be base64 encoded and no longer than 4096 characters (prior to base64 encoding).
The text will be shown to the user in the Freja app while authenticating.

Advanced signatures are only available for Swedish users.
Advanced signatures require the Social Security Number and the Basic User Information (i.e. name) of the user.
These scopes will automatically be added to your request if the Advanced signature flow is activated.

[Try out an example Advanced signature in our Authorize URL builder.](/verify/guides/authorize-url-builder/?acr_values=urn:grn:authn:se:frejaid&frejaAction=sign_advanced&message=Test%20advanced%20signature%20flow&title=Advanced%20signature)

### Signature responses

When the user has approved a Simple or an Extended signature, the JWT will contain the claims `certificateStatus` and `userSignature`.
When the user has approved an Advanced signature, the JWT will contain the claims `certificateStatus`, `userSignature` and `advancedSignature`.

The `certificateStatus` claim contains the OCSP response regarding the user certificate status when the signature was validated.
The `userSignature` claim contains the signature of the user.
The `advancedSignature` claim contains an XML signature containing the signature method, signature value, certificate chain, signing time and text presented to the user in the Freja app.

<Highlight icon="exclamation" warning>
  Note that signing can produce very large JWTs which are not appropriate for use in `Bearer`
  headers. This means that JWTs produced from signature flows can often not be used for
  authentication.
</Highlight>

### Features available for all signature types

You can add a title to be displayed in the Freja app over the text to sign by adding the `title` hint in the `login_hint`.
The text in the `title` hint must be base64 encoded and no longer than 128 characters (prior to base64 encoding).

The Freja app may sometimes send a push notification to the user's device if the user information is prefilled.
The push notification will contain a default title and message, but you can customize it.
Use the `pushTitle` and `pushText` hints in the `login_hint` to override the default push notification.
Both the push notification title and the push notification text must be base64 encoded and no longer than 256 characters each (prior to base64 encoding).

## Ordering FrejaID

To start accepting real users with FrejaID, you must first request a certificate to identify your organization.

You will have to go through a simple approval process with FrejaID. The process is managed by Idura.
Please <a href="https://idura.eu/contact" target="_blank">contact sales</a> to initiate the process. The whole process typically takes 7-10 business days.

Once your organization and your intended use of FrejaID has been approved we will create and install the actual certificate in your Idura tenant.
You will then be ready to continue the process in the [getting ready for production guide](/verify/guides/production).
